Our students have delighted us  with a cornucopia of creative projects each quarter. This gallery shares a sampling of that awesomeness. What cool thing will YOU be inspired to create?

Click below to view a short highlight reel from the project demonstration session in Spring 2017.

Here are descriptions of some projects from other past years:

* Noob Cube
  - Graphical viewer for a 3D wireframe
* Pi Selfie Mirror
  - Take a selfie with animations displayed on a mirror-monitor
* Chess but cool
  - Chess board that can record & visualize moves on a screen (using Hall-effect sensors)
* Threading system
  - Build threading system so Pi can simulate running code in parallel
* Pi-ke
  - Bike system with indicator lights, user display
* Keyboard Orchestra
  - Record/play music using keyboard
* Sunlight lamp
  - Lamp that mirrors natural sunlight intensity throughout day
* Raspberry Pi Bongos
  - Electronic drumset with piezoelectric vibration sensors
* SPI Network with Slave-Slave communication
  - Communication between Pis (display received data, store to memory, run received code)
* The Fruit Ninjas
  - Fruit-ninja inspired game controlled by user hand gestures (sonar sensors)
* Theremins visualized
  - Translate time-of-flight distance to pitch and output sound and visualization
* Synthetic Music
  - Synthetic instrument using piezo sensors on fingers, and output sound and visualization
* Electronic dress
  - Dress which lights up with electroluminescent wires when you move
    (based on gyroscope)
* Extended etch-a-sketch
  - Takes input from two knobs, accelerometer, and push buttons:
    controls menu UI and paint program
* ArduCAM
  - A library to access ArduCAM with the Raspberry Pi, along with a
    shell to enter commands (filters, camera settings) and display
    output
* Robo-Turtle
  - A robotic turtle with servo motors and ultrasonic sensor (for
    self-driving), controllable with an NES controller
* Game Boy emulator
* Raspberry Pi GPU
  - An assembler which targets the Pi GPU, some sample assembly
    programs, and a guide to using the GPU from bare metal
* Intruder detection system
  - Uses a network of passive infrared sensors around the room to detect motion
* DMX lighting console and receiver
  - User interface to see lighting data, plus commands like setting
    light color, setting intensity, patching the light, changing the
    fixture type
* 2-player basketball arcade game
  - Uses Apple remote to choose time to play, then uses IR sensor to
    check when ball goes into basket. Sounds buzzer when a player
    scores.
* Sensor visualizer
  - Car dashboard-like visualization of MCP3008 ADC, including a GL
    library
* CNC drawing machine
  - A user's picture painted on Pi is drawn on a Post-It using a pen controlled by stepper motors.
* Vintage boombox
  - Plays music through a refitted vintage radio case with LED visualization.
* LED leggings
  - Leggings with sewn-in LEDs that respond to movement of wearer.
* Magic organ
  - Multiple stops that shape frequency signature of sound akin to pipe organ.
* Gesture-controlled car
  - Wirelessly controlled via a glove outfitted with sensors
* Text-a-sketch
  - Pi receives texted photo and drives stepper motors to control an Etch-a-Sketch to draw the photo
  
Talk to the course staff if you want more information or you think you
could use code from one of these projects.
