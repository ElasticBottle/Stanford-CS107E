Here we have gathered links to various interactive demos and online visualizations that CS107E students have found useful in the past. Check them out!

- [Raspberry Pi GPIO Pinout](https://pinout.xyz/). Nice way to see alternate
  functions by clicking each pin. Also, click Ground and you see all the
  other Ground pins.

- An interactive demo of how the
[ARM assembler's immediate value encoder](https://alisdair.mcdiarmid.org/arm-immediate-value-encoding/#play-with-it) works.

- Download [VisUAL](http://salmanarif.bitbucket.io/visual/index.html) and play with it. This visual simulator emulates the ARM instruction set and allows you to step through an assembly program. Pat used this tool in lecture.
    
    _Note: VisUAL uses a [slightly different ARM assembly syntax](http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.dui0773a/chr1383143764305.html) from the GNU syntax we use in the course -- for example, you don't put colons after labels in VisUAL._

- Matt Godbolt's [Compiler Explorer](http://gcc.godbolt.org/) lets you
  quickly see how C source code maps to compiled assembly. 
  
    _Note: Be sure to set the compiler `ARM gcc 5.4.1(none)`, which is close to what we use._

- [cdecl.org](http://cdecl.org/) converts "C gibberish" declarations to and from English.

- [Repl](https://repl.it/languages/c) can run C code for you.
This can be handy when you need to quickly execute a small passage of C to see what it does.

- This virtual [Seven Segment Display](http://www.uize.com/examples/seven-segment-display.html)
will come in handy in lab2. This site shows how to relate a bit pattern to a character drawn on a seven-segment-display.

- A neat visualization of [reversing a string](http://pgbovine.net/rosetta/c-demo.html).
