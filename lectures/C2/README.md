    + __Note__:  Monday is a university holiday. Julie will cover key content in a makeup lecture so we can keep on schedule. Please come Monday evening 7pm in Gates B12 if you are willing/able (or watch screencast once posted).
    + Before lecture, read [EssentialC](http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/101/EssentialC.pdf) chapters 3 (skip material on structures)
      and 6 (skip material on the heap and memory management)
      or K&amp;R 5.1-5.4.
      C-strings are primitive compared to Java/C++ strings; take note of the manual effort required to use and pitfalls to avoid.
