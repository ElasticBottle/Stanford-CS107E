### Goals

You're coming down to the finish line now! During lab, we'd like to check in with you to hear how your first week of the project has gone and review your plans for the next week to ensure you are on track for successful completion.

1. Assess how well you met your week 1 goal(s)
2. Confirm that you have all your hardware
3. Begin planning for your demo

Review the [project writeup](/assignments/project) for information on the project.

### Check in with TA

Before the end of the lab period, be sure to touch base with us on these issues:

* What were your week 1 goals, and did you meet them? (If no, how will you change your plans?)

* How will you show off your creation on the final day?

* If you are not using your PS/2 keyboard for your project, please return it to a TA now.
