### Goals

Unlike our previous labs, this one won't be you following our guided exercises, instead you're now ready to branch out on your own journey. During this lab, you will be laying plans for your final project. What cool aspect of computer systems do you want to explore?  What neat hardware do you want to involve? How will you coordinate with your team to execute on your plan?  We advise you to:

1.  Sync up with your team about the project (if applicable)
2.  Get a start on your project proposal
3.  Curate the hardware you need
4.  Identify the key issues to resolve in week 1 so as to be on track for completion.

Refer to the [project writeup](/assignments/project) for more information on the project itself.

### Check in with TA

Before the end of the lab period, be sure to confirm the following items with us:

* What is the gist of your project?

* What do you wish to accomplish with your project?

* Can each of you access the team repository?

* What progress do you expect to make this week?

* If your project requires additional hardware, what is your plan for acquiring all the materials you need in a timely fashion?
